Have Chrome installed and want to use it's built-in Flash plugin for your other browsers without installing Flash manually?

This small script searches for the current Flash plugin version inside the Chrome app bundle and will link the file to the Internet Plug-Ins folder inside your Library.

This quick and dirty script has been lying on my hard drive for some time now and I thought it might be useful for someone else as well.

The included App bundle is just a nice wrapper that was created with Platypus (http://sveinbjorn.org/platypus). Look inside the bundle if you don't trust it ;)
